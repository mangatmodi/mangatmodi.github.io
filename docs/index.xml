      <description>I have been writing on Medium until now, which has been a great experience for me. I really appreciate the simplcity and quality of the platform. Also the posts are SEO optimised. Without me trying to spread my posts I still got some handsome traffic from Google. Infact one of my blog is also a top search result. But I wish things were that simple. I found Medium paywall system highly intrusive.</description>

      <description>I had a simple problem. I have a function which takes a parameter of type interface{}. I need to check it for nil. Any seasoned Go developer will know that a simple i==nil check will not work because interfaces in Go contains both type and value. So you can have cases when â€”
 Type is null-able(like map, pointer etc) and value is nil Type itself is nil (of course value will be nil)  A nil will only work with option 2 above, as for option 1 a variable still have some type.</description>
