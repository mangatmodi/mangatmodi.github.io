      <description>I have been writing on Medium until now, which has been a great experience for me. I really appreciate the simplcity and quality of the platform. Also the posts are SEO optimised. Without me trying to spread my posts I still got some handsome traffic from Google. Infact one of my blog is also a top search result. But I wish things were that simple. I found Medium paywall system highly intrusive.</description>
